I ordered a extra size large cheese pizza, after I an hour I recieved a regular pizza with no topping. When I asked then they said this was what I ordered and started arguing with me	0

Good one ! Best for evening snacks requirement üòÖ Provides alomost all varieties..whether it is Indian, western or continental. Food quality is good and it is also cost efficient. Shopowner is firm to customers. At last Good place which you can afford..And sometimes their food's taste differs as per their financial & marketing condition.	1

Hello. Please give our thanks to the Manager(s) and others for the wonderful room and bottle of sparkling wine for our Anniversary stay. We had an amazing time. The room was so comfortable, the food at Echo absolutely spectacular (we ate two meals there). Our waitress was just wonderful. Looking forward to staying with you in the future. What a great place!	1

I had lunch with some of my colleagues at Echo on Day 1. I had the wedge salad - it was delicious. On Night 2, I enjoyed a drink at the bar. I had a Margarita. The service was excellent.	1

They have horrible attitudes towards customers.	0
The quantity and quality of the food was high. It was delicious and right amount of elements were served with it. The roll and the chowmein were quite appreciating. 	1
I'm not sure what is up with the other reviews, but I have to strongly disagree.	0
not good really, it tasted really bad	0
Service was very good and servers were kind, friendly	1
Maggot in the food and how disgusting the place looks inside.	0
Horrible experience.	0
My wife's food had hair in it.	0
We have had two meals here in two days.  Both were excellent.	1
Would've been five stars had the service been up to par with the food.	0
The ambience is good with good space for guests. The lawn is well maintained and is rented for party and social gatherings. The menu is wide in range and food is good in taste and served prompt. The price is nominal and staffs are proactive and we'll mannered. It's a great place for family, office gatherings and corporate lunch or dinner.	1
There service is not upto the mark, had high hopes with the most rated restaurant.	0
The folks at Yotto always make us feel so welcome.	1
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0

I'm not sure what is up with the other reviews, but I have to strongly disagree. Maybe Mija fired the old staff and hired new ones? I'm not sure, but I definitely did not share the same experience as others on here. I went here with a friend as a spur of the moment type deal. We got chips with guacamole for the appetizer, I got a virgin pi√±a colada, and chicken quesadillas for my entr√©e (even though technically they were another appetizer). My friend got a margarita, a pi√±a colada, and beef quesadillas. For dessert we got the churros with chocolate. The chips were good, and the guacamole was even better. The quesadillas were so filling and cheesy we didn't even order an entr√©e. My friend said her drinks were strong, and I loved my virgin pi√±a coladas. The churros were so fresh, and the chocolate was warm and smooth. The decor was an interesting mix of western and modern. Our server Chrystina did a great job, and really made the evening pleasant. Our orders came out in a timely manner and were exactly what we wanted. The only small complaint I have is that my friend and I were going to sit at an outside table, but they had the heaters going (it's summer) and pointed directly at them. So we ended up sitting inside.	0
for 50 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
Do you love Tequila?  If so, come to this restaurant.  Although it's located in Faneuil Hall, it's not a tourist attraction joint, not to me, at least. I have come here a handful of times in the last few years and most recently came in on "National Tequila Day" on February 22, 2020.  My boyfriend and I came in and enjoyed a "Make Your Own Margarita" bar.  How fun!!! Greeting upon entrance was friendly, we the got seated immediately, the greeting by the waitress upon seating was immediate and over the top friendly, and food was delish to top it off.   We ordered the wings and nachos.  OMG!  Delish and potion size that actually met the price we were paying. The chicken wings were cooked to perfection.  The wings were a mountain! I asked for light on the cheese, no queso and and add veggies. The veggies were quartered pieces of zucchini, broccoli, mushroom, squash, and carrot (veggies from a fajita). What a way to add more of a nutritional value to the average nachos.  YUM!  Thank you for offering the veggies to what is usually a mountain of calories.  And stll, the chips were crispy.  Fave nachos evah. Cheers to this place!	1
REVIEW from the pre-pandemic era in early March. We were here to catch a Jet Blue flight. The restaurant was somewhat full, but we were quickly shown to a table (and it has a power outlet to charge our phones yay!). However, service was super slow. We waited forever just to place our order, and then more long wait and we were almost late for our flight. When food finally came they completely forgot about the nachos we ordered. She would not admit it though, and no apologies! Terrible service. Food was just OK. Very ... airport food. Was hoping for better (at least Mexican food should be tastey and not too hard to make)	0
Had dinner with girl friends. Menu is perfect, something for everyone. Service was awesome and Jason was very accommodating. Will be back definitely!	1
Visited as a guest in the Echo restaurant for lunch just today. We were entertaining friends from California, and enjoyed our ocean side table. We chose to stay indoors - to enjoy the air conditioning üòä. I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waitress, Jackie. She had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. She recognized that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. She and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed. Kudos!	1
We had lunch here a few times while on the island visiting family and friends. The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems. We sat on the ocean front patio and enjoyed the view with our delicious wine and lunch. Must try!	1
Although we didn't go into the onsite restaurant, we ordered some food at the bar a few times and it was delicious. The bar area and lobby were nice and open, good place to relax and meet friends.	1
